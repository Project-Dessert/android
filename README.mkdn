Getting started
---------------

To get started with Android/Project Dessert, you'll need to get familiar with [Source Control Tools](https://source.android.com/setup/develop).

To initialize your local repository using the dessert trees, use a command like this:
```
repo init -u https://github.com/Project-Dessert/android.git -b snowcone
```
Then to sync up:
```
repo sync
```
Please see the [LineageOS Wiki](https://wiki.lineageos.org/) for building instructions, by device.
